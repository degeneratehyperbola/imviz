# pyimplot

Rudimentary python bindings for the great [implot](https://github.com/epezent/implot) library with similarities to matplotlib.

This is for the people who are too impatient to wait for matplotlib to render
10e5 data points. And for the people who are just completely unwilling or
utterly incapable (me) to deal with application state management in Qt
(otherwise [pyqtgraph](http://pyqtgraph.org/) would be fine).
